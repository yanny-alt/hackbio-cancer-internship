# HackBio Bioinformatics Internship

## Overview

This repository contains all the work and projects completed as part of the HackBio Bioinformatics Internship program. The internship is designed to provide hands-on experience in bioinformatics, including technical writing, literature review, coding, data analysis, and pipeline implementation. Each stage of the internship builds on the previous one, culminating in a final project that integrates all the skills acquired.

## Stages

### Stage 0: Technical Writing
In this stage, I developed essential technical writing skills, focusing on clear and concise communication of complex scientific concepts. The tasks involved writing a short essay on a key concept in Data Science and Machine Learning as it relates to cancer research.

- **[Stage 0 Folder](./Stage0_Technical_Writing/)**
  - **[README.md](./Stage0_Technical_Writing/README.md)**: Overview of the technical writing stage.
  - **[essay.md](./Stage0_Technical_Writing/essay.md)**: Essay on Supervised Learning in Cancer Research.
  - **images/**: Directory containing images used in the essay.

### Upcoming Stages
The repository will be updated with subsequent stages of the internship as they are completed. Below is a brief overview of what to expect:

- **Stage 1: Literature Review**
  - A comprehensive literature review of bioinformatics research, identifying gaps and formulating research questions.

- **Stage 2: Coding and Visualization**
  - Application of coding skills to analyze biological data and create meaningful visualizations.

- **Stage 3: Pipeline Implementation for a Basic Problem Set**
  - Building and implementing a bioinformatics pipeline to solve a predefined problem set.

- **Stage 4: Pipeline Implementation II**
  - Reproducing the results of a published bioinformatics paper.

- **Stages 5-7: Final Project**
  - A comprehensive project that integrates all the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the internship.

## How to Navigate This Repository

- **Stages**: Each stage of the internship has its own directory containing all relevant files, including essays, code, and images.
- **README Files**: Each stage directory contains a `README.md` that provides an overview and instructions specific to that stage.
- **Code and Data**: If applicable, code and datasets used in the stages will be stored in their respective directories.
